# Tours 🏖️

> PROD [Live] : https://react-tours-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Tours consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of tours available to visit.
- Each single tour card has an **image**,**name**, **price**, **info** along with a button to toggle between **Read more** or **Show less** and a **Not Interested** button to remove a tour from the list.
- **`Loading`** spinner will be shown while fetching data, once the data is available tours will be shown.
- Data is handled by the external API.
- Once all the tours are removed from the list, it displays _No Tours left_ and a **Refresh** button which on click fetches the tours again.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
